Conclusion
==========

As an internee of EXIM Bank Ltd. I have truly enjoying my internship from the learning and experience viewpoint. I am confident that this three months internship program at EXIM Bank will definitely help me to realize my further carrier in the job market. EXIM bank has converted all of their system and policy of traditional banking to Islami Banking. I think which a very practical and bold decision is. As there are lots of local and foreign banks in Bangladesh the EXIM Bank Ltd. is promising commercial Bank among them. In this competitive market Exim Bank has to compete not only the others commercial banks but also with the public Bank. EXIM Bank Ltd. is more capable of contributing towards economic development as compared with other bank. Exim Bank Ltd. invested more funds in export and import business. It is obvious that the right thinking of this bank including establishing a successful network over the country and increasing resources will be able to play a considerable role in the portfolio of development. Success in the banking business largely depends on effective lending.

During the course of my practical orientation I have tried to learn the practical banking activities to realize it with my theoretical knowledge, which I have greathearted and going to acquire from various courses of my MBA Program.
