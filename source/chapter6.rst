Recommendations
===============
EXIM Bank of Bangladesh Limited should try to develop the process of providing services. To get a perfect process of delivering services, the customers should be asked. In the recent study customer put emphasis mostly on one-stop customer services. An exploratory research should be conducted to find out the other elements that have impact over the efficacy of customer services.

   • If the enter general Banking system is fully computerized then they satisfy the customer by provide fast service.
   • If they establish networking system with their branches then it can easily transfer data within short time.
   • Customer satisfied with the price charge by EXIM, but they have not too much awareness about the price charged. Customer’s awareness should be build over pricing strategy.
   • Local office should take more bills that will develop the awareness of customer.
   • The office layout should be designed in a way so that, there is no chance of confusing customer. The cash receive section will be totally separated from the cash paying section.
   • Some offices are decorated in a much-unstructured way. All the offices should be decorated with the help of Interior Design Company. So that maximum efficacy of services can be provided.
   • Customer is the hearts of the organization. They should provide more space in the office and if possible, they should have some entertainment facility. For example: a television with some dynamic channels like discovery, animal planet, national geography etc. as a result they will be more patient while the services has been processed.
   • The employees of the different branch should be trained continuously.
   • As because bank is a financial institution, the EXIM should recruit more persons, having commerce backgrounds.
   • Each branch should be decorated with electronic display board, which will show that which table is performing what function and now that is serving. The branches should be decorated with proper sound system facility, which will be helpful to communicate with the customer more easily. This system will decrease the confusion of the customer, which ultimately will increase the efficiency of customer services.
   • The employees of the cash counter are the persons who are having direct contact with the customer. So, these employees should be more smart and active.
   • Foreign exchange is the most profitable department of each branch.

So, EXIM should think about opening more branches internationally, mostly where they have enough operations. It will facilitate the foreign trade. As a result, efficacy at the foreign trade will be increased.
